Simple travel theme portfolio site

This project uses Bootstrap 3 and jQuery. One of my first portfolio sites created after enrolling in Google developer challenge.
Some of the features include:-
1. Hovering on the images in the Gallery increases the size of the image.
2. On click of images in the Travel wiki section ,a caption is displayed under the image.
3. Depending on the section clicked in the nav bar the corresponding section is displayed.
4. On click of the down arrow in the Home page ,the next section is displayed.

Responsive design
